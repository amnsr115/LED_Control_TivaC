# LED_Control_TivaC
This Project shows the interfacing of the TM4C123GH6PM Microcontroller.
Drivers were writen for each of the following:
GPIO (Port, DIO)
NVIC
Timer

An application was developed where an LED in the system would toggle with diffrent On and OFF times. The Toggle times were changable during runtime with the use of GPIO Interupts.
